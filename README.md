## CSharp Exercise

### Working with Generic Class & Constraints

1. Create a Custom Generic C# class named `MyStack`. This class should contain `Push`, `Pop` methods and `Count` property. `Push` Method should Take only class object as argument and should create an in memory stack representation of given object type. `Pop` method should remove and return the object in top of the stack. `Count` property should hold number of object in the Stack. 
 
2. Write a C# program to create a Custom Generic class  with name `DoublyLinkedList`. This class should contain `AddFirst`,`AddLast`,`RemoveFirst`,`RemoveLast` methods and `Count` property. The `AddFirst` and `AddLast` methods accept any class object as arguments and internally creates an in memeory Doubly Linked List of the given objects. `RemoveFirst` and `RemoveLast` methods reove and return the Object from beginning or end of the list respectively.`Count` property maitains number of objects in the doubly linked list.
